# estd: Common Lisp utility library

This library is a collection of functions and macros that provide some
functionality missing from the Common Lisp standard library that I found useful
in my CL work; in fact, most of the stuff in estd was included because I had
written it as a utility in multiple different projects and wanted a conveient
place to put it so that I could use it at any time.
